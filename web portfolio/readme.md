I have created this website for UX assignment sharing my skills in photography and videography. All the Images taken and editing by my self. 

While building this site i had some probems for my Videos but I asked my professor for help and I get the idea to write it. However I couldn't responsive the videos.

Using Bootstrap is funny it will help you in the break point. But you have to add  a lot of information to see your page.
